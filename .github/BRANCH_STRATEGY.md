# Branch Strategy

## Default Branch

This repository uses `main` as the default branch.

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch should be protected to ensure code quality:
- All changes should go through pull requests
- Pull requests should be reviewed before merging
- Tests should pass before merging (when applicable)

## Working with Branches

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request to merge back into `main`
4. After review and approval, merge the pull request
